### Shiny Assignment

We've been given a dataset about foreign students who are in Turkey. After some data cleaning and analysis processes I've prepared a Shiny app.

It consists of two separates tabs: "The distribution of top N foreign students by their nations" and "Foreign Student's Distribution by Province"
