After installation step we have to call the packages :

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

First, we take a look at the data to see how many columns and rows we have, as well as what types of data we have :

```{r,message=FALSE}
glimpse(planes)
```

In "plane" dataset we have information about each plane's construction. 

### Number of plane counts by the seat for AIRBUS

```{r,message=FALSE}
#| warning: false
planes %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "AIRBUS INDUSTRIE") %>% 
  group_by(seats) %>% 
  summarise(count_of_planes = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_of_planes))
```

### For each manufacturer oldest, newest plane model and counts

```{r,message=FALSE}
#| warning: false
planes %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(min_model_year = min(year, na.rm = T), max_model_year = max(year, na.rm = T),distinct_plane_counts =n_distinct(tailnum)) %>% 
  arrange(manufacturer)  %>%
  print(n = Inf) 

```
