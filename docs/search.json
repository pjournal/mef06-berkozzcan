I have 5 years of experience in Analytical departments, before that, I worked as a merchandise planner in several retail companies. One of my biggest aim is after this program, I want to get a promotion to become Analytics Manager. I work with mostly SQL and Python in my current job. With my new skills I believe that I can handle complex problems, also in this field we always have to get to update our knowledge and I could enhance my understanding of data and analytics through my education.\nMy linkedin profile"

In this video, we can learn the usage of Git and GitHub, why they are important in our life and some bash codes for administrating the pipeline.\nFirstly we should understand the notion of version control. With version control, we can manage changes to projects over time, and also we can track changes to files.\nThere are several reasons why we are using version control:\n\nCollaboration : Simultaneously work on the same orıject\nTracking : Record the development of a project\nRestoring versions : Restore older versions of a file\nBack-up : Save your work in a remote repository.\n\nWHY GIT:\n-Second generation version control system -Unique approach to tracking changes -Streamlined collaboration -Manages evolution of a project -Fast and lightweight branching -Commit messages provide context -Safe testing and experimentation\nWHY GITHUB\n-Provides cloud storage for our project -Like dropbox but with better features -It allows us to: view and review our work sync with a project *report issues/bugs -contribute to the project -Great way to promote our skills and interests\nSome Git Terms we have to know\nRepository Commit Push/Pull Branch Pull/Merge request Issues\nWith this suggested video also ensures how can we use the tool with bash/shell codes."

In this part i examined how can we use this algorithm in R.\nFor this example, we’ll use the Default dataset from the ISLR package. We can use the following code to load and view a summary of the dataset:\n\noptions(repos=\"https://cran.rstudio.com\" )\ninstall.packages(\"ISLR\")\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/k_/k4ydmc5n4f3f0mxzm8sy4x7c9_8lsp/T//RtmpWAEjQT/downloaded_packages\n\nlibrary(\"ISLR\")\n\ndata <- ISLR::Default\n\nsummary(data)\n\n default    student       balance           income     \n No :9667   No :7056   Min.   :   0.0   Min.   :  772  \n Yes: 333   Yes:2944   1st Qu.: 481.7   1st Qu.:21340  \n                       Median : 823.6   Median :34553  \n                       Mean   : 835.4   Mean   :33517  \n                       3rd Qu.:1166.3   3rd Qu.:43808  \n                       Max.   :2654.3   Max.   :73554  \n\n\nNext, we’ll split the dataset into a training set to train the model on and a testing set to test the model on.\n\n#make this example reproducible\nset.seed(1)\n\n#Use 70% of dataset as training set and remaining 30% as testing set\nsample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(data), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7,0.3))\ntrain <- data[sample, ]\ntest <- data[!sample, ]   \n\nNext, we’ll use the glm (general linear model) function and specify family=“binomial” so that R fits a logistic regression model to the dataset:\n\n#fit logistic regression model\n\nmodel <- glm(default~student+balance+income, family=\"binomial\", data=train)\n\n#disable scientific notation for model summary\noptions(scipen=999)\n\n#view model summary\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = default ~ student + balance + income, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = train)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  \n-2.5586  -0.1353  -0.0519  -0.0177   3.7973  \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate    Std.
